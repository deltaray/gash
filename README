== Setup ==

BASH users:

  Set your PROMPT_COMMAND to the following.

  PROMPT_COMMAND="lastreturn=\$? ; history | gash -i -C \$COLUMNS -l \$lastreturn"

  You could also append this to something you already have, you'd just have to
  make sure that lastreturn=\$? happens before anything else so that you don't
  get the return value of something you run in the PROMPT_COMMAND value.

  You should setup this variable in your .bashrc file so that it is set when
  you start bash interactively each time.

ZSH users:

  zsh has a 

== Config file options ==

Settings can be one of the following types:
 - An alphanumeric string [a-zA-Z0-9]
 - A boolean value which can be one of yes, no, 1 or 0.
 - An alphanumeric list (string values as above, seperated by commas)


 utf8_mode (default: yes) - Uses utf-8 characters available now on most popular terminals.

 display_256colors (default: yes) - Use 256 color xterm output available now on most terminals.

 hud_display (default: yes) - Turn on or off the character stats display (HUD = Heads Up Display)

 hud_type (default: beforeprompt) - Change how the HUD is displayed.

    beforeprompt - A single line before each prompt.

    box - Draw a nice box in the upper right corner of your terminal.
          The setback of using this option is that it overwrites whatever
          was output from the previous command you ran in that corner
          of the terminal and it clutters up your scrollback history with
          every write.

    topline - A single line at the top of the terminal. This also
              has the drawback of overwriting the top line of your last 
              program's output.

 hud_color_fg (default: blue)- The foreground color of your HUD. See ANSI colors and attributes section.
 hud_color_bg (default: normal) - The background color of your HUD. See ANSI colors and attributes section.
 hud_color_attr - A comma seperated list of ANSI attributes used on the HUD text. See ANSI colors and attributes section.

 messages_display (default: yes) - The messages display comes up when you level up, encounter things, take damage, game messages, etc.
 messages_color_fg (default: yellow) - The foreground color of the Messages area. See ANSI colors and attributes section.
 messages_color_bg (default: normal) - The background color of the Messages area. See ANSI colors and attributes section.
 messages_color_attr - A comma seperated list of ANSI attributes used on the messages area. See ANSI colors and attributes section.

 silence (default: no) - Controls all output of all messages and displays in Gash. Set to yes to turn all displays off.

 leaderboard (default: no) - Connect with Gash worldwide leaderboard at gash.climagic.org
 leaderboard_authcode (default: NULL) - Authentication code for connecting to leaderboard.


== Environment variables ==

  The following environment variables can be set so you can quickly control some aspects of gash that you may 
  wish to override for a little bit:

  GASH_HUD - Set to 0 to turn off the HUD. 
  GASH_MESSAGES - Set to 0 to turn off the message display
  GASH_SILENCE - Set to 1 to turn off all gash messages.
  GASH_VERBOSE, GASH_DEBUG - This is for developers to quickly check things.

    Example of usage:

      $ export GASH_HUD=0

    To turn the HUD back on:

      $ export -n GASH_HUD  # This unexports the variable.

      or 

      $ unset GASH_HUD
